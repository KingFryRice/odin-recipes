# odin-recipes
Project: Recipes
This is my first project in which I will utilize the beginner skills taught in The Odin Project.
Among those skills, I create several html files, filling them out with the basic boilerplate.
From there, I utilize headings, paragraphs, both ordered and unordered lists, as well as various other formatting tags.
I create a main page called index, where it will host links to three other html files that have images and recipes.
Overall this project demonstrates that I understand very basic html structuring and language.
